# RENÉJA9 × FlightLine — Neon Archive System

This repository is the **official digital authority layer** for RENÉJA9.

Every RENÉJA9 creation is:
• Physically handcrafted as a 1-of-1 artifact  
• Digitally sealed through FlightLine verification  
• Geospatially registered through a closed-loop map system  
• Permanently archived through public proof  

What enters as art, exits as authority — and returns as legacy.

---

## SYSTEM FUNCTION

This repo mirrors the live operational pipeline:

• RENÉJA9 Physical PEN Builds  
• PINS-on-PENS Covenant Activations  
• Proof Registry (immutable digital record)  
• Terminal Classification (Arrival / Departure / Covenant)  
• Closed-Loop Geospatial Verification  
• Public Neon Gallery Interface  

---

## VERIFIED STATES

Each asset passes through structured states:

QUEUED → ACTIVATED → DELIVERED → ARCHIVED  

Each state is time-stamped and permanently bound to its Proof ID.

---

## CLOSED-LOOP POLICY

This repository reflects **authority, not raw location data**.  
Public view shows activation and proof — **never unsecured coordinates**.

---

## NO DUPLICATION GUARANTEE

RENÉJA9 builds are strictly:

• 1-of-1  
• Non-replicable  
• Permanently registered  
• Covenant bound when applicable  

No rebuilds. No clones. No resets.
